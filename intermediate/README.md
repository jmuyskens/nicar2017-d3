# Nesting
Goal is to structure your data the way you want your DOM to look.
A quick note on functional programming APIs in JavaScript:
Filter: separate the wheat from the chaff
Map: apply a function to an array, producing a new array. Remember to return! (also forEach)
Reduce: iterate over an array, producing a single value. If you just want to sum or do simple stats you can use d3.sum etc.

`Nest` is like groupBy in other fx programming langs
`.entries` returns an array
`.map` returns an object which is useful for creating lookup tables. There's also .object which you can use if you are sure your data doesn't collide with js reserved words. JS objects not equal to hash tables like python dicts but can be used in much the same way

# Dates
They both take a format string as an argument and return a function that does what it says on the tin.
`d3.dateParse` returns a f: String ðŸ”œ Date
`d3.dateFormat` returns a f: Date ðŸ”œ String

The format DSL is like strptime in other langs worth learning the most common args

# Scale options
scaleTime
scaleSqrt
scaleLog
scaleOrdinal

# Axis formatting options
.tickSize specify length of ticks
.ticks specify number of ticks, but d3 does some thinking for you (TK why)
The backbone of the axis is a <path> while the ticks are <line>s so you can easily style them separately.

# Advanced nesting for multiple time series
You can keep adding layers to your nest by adding `.key`s. Our line function expects an array of arrays because the enter pattern expects an array and the line function also expects an array.
Note that there are missing values

# Scatterplot
We won't need to nest data
Change y axis
Write new enter pattern for circle

# Interaction
.on
mouseenter
mouseleave
mouseover
touch?
how you would integrate tooltips
how to select this element

# Voronoi
Improve your scatter interaction
Visualize voronoi
Connect to circles

# Transitions
transition x axis

# what's in the advanced class
Layouts (force, heirarchy)
Geo tools
Modules
Behaviors (drag and zoom)
Canvas

# libraries and tools you may find useful
crowbar
jetpack
